In the cloud era, the application platform will be delivered as a service, often described as Platform as a Service (PaaS). PaaS makes it much easier to deploy, run and scale applications. Some PaaS offerings have limited language and framework support, do not deliver key application services, or restrict deployment to a single cloud. Cloud Foundry is the industry’s Open PaaS and provides a choice of clouds, frameworks and application services. As an open source project, there is a broad community both contributing and supporting Cloud Foundry.

Open cloud and open source are only part of the transformation underway, there is also a massive narrative building around continuous innovation and high velocity agile development. Some open source projects foster inclusiveness and sacrifice velocity while some increase velocity at the expense of transparency. Cloud Foundry.org’s unique vision is to foster contributions from a broad community of developers, users, customers, partners and ISVs while advancing development of the platform at extreme velocity. Cloud Foundry.org exists to provide a platform for the community of customers, partners and even former competitors to collaborate, teach, share and learn together, accelerating the pace of innovation and contribution.  The best way to [get involved](getin) is to [join the conversation](https://groups.google.com/a/cloudfoundry.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vcap-dev), contribute to the [wiki](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki) and [fork the code](https://github.com/cloudfoundry). We call it ‘fierce collaboration’ and we hope you will join us.

### Cloud Foundry's Community Advisory Board

The CAB’s mission is to foster a healthy, vibrant, collaborative and innovative community and ecosystem around the Cloud Foundry platform and open source project.

This scope includes:

* Feedback on the Cloud Foundry roadmap, along with feature advocacy.
* Advice on the day-to-day operation of the Cloud Foundry project. For example: how to manage pull requests, select committers, track issues, manage CI, and interact with the community at large (through hangouts, IRC, email forums, etc.).
* Feedback on the Cloud Foundry community web site (cloudfoundry.org) and mechanisms for community website contributions.
* Help in establishing agenda and format for future Platform conferences.
* Guidance on the Cloud Foundry charter, including project scope and definition of any ‘cloud profiles’.
