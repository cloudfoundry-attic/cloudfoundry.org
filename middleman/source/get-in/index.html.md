## Contribute Code

Below are the general steps to make a code contribution.  For each project, please review the repository's README to see if there are any other specific instructions.

1. Ensure that you have either completed our CLA Agreement for [individuals](http://www.cloudfoundry.org/individualcontribution.pdf) or are a public member of an organization that has signed the [corporate](http://www.cloudfoundry.org/corpcontribution.pdf) CLA.

2. Set your name and email (these should match the information on your submitted CLA):

        git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
        git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

3. Fork the project's repository

4. Create a feature branch (e.g. ```git checkout -b better_bosh```) and make changes on your branch

5. Push to your fork (e.g. ```git push origin better_bosh```) and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

If you have a CLA on file, your contribution will be analyzed for engineering quality and product fit prior to merging.

Note: All contributions need to be sent using GitHub Pull Requests, and we favor pull requests with very small, single commits with a single purpose.  Your pull request is much more likely to be accepted if it includes tests and is small and focused with a clear message that conveys the intent of your change.
